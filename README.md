# Efficient-fire-detection-using-ONN
To perform this Fire detection task, we have
used an Operational Neural Network (ONN) that gives us good results compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. The ONN is a new type of convolutional neural network that
significantly reduces the number of parameters, making it a good trade-off between
model complexity and efficiency.
