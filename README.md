# Efficient-fire-detection-using-ONN
"We utilized an Operational Neural Network (ONN) to successfully detect fires, which has proven to be more effective than other state-of-the-art methods. The ONN is a convolutional neural network with a reduced number of parameters, providing a balance of complexity and efficiency."
